Zoel
====

Just a small little Zork clone, based on Zork.

### FOR VISUAL STUDIO USERS

When running through visual studio, Zoel will report that its missing files if you don't copy them from the root into the Zoel_VS\Zoel folder

#### TODO:

* Make a nice default story.
* Make zmaps store enemies.
* Devise a good way to save room location in save files.

##### Notes

* I do not own openal in anyway. It is licensed under GPLv2, I have not edited it, It's just in the repo to make linking easier.
