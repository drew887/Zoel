Zoel
====

Just a small little Zork clone, based off of my work with Joel. :D

###FOR VISUAL STUDIO USERS
When running through visual studio, Zoel will report that its missing files if you don't copy them from the root into the Zoel_VS\Zoel folder

####TODO:
Redo most of the code over again, this project turned into a giant mess of spaghetti code.
