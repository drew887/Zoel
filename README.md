Zoel
====

Just a small little Zork clone, based on Zork.

###FOR VISUAL STUDIO USERS

When running through visual studio, Zoel will report that its missing files if you don't copy them from the root into the Zoel_VS\Zoel folder

####TODO:

* Make a nice default story.

#####Notes

* I do not own openal in anyway.
