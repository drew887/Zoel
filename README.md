Zoel
====

Just a small little Zork clone, based on Zork.

### FOR VISUAL STUDIO USERS

When running through visual studio, Zoel will report that its missing files if you don't copy them from the root into the Zoel_VS\Zoel folder. Note that these are just the demo provided files, if you make your own zmaps and change zoel.ini you don't need these.

* zoel.ini
* town.zmap
* sfat.wav
* test.zmap
* sub.wav
    
#### TODO:

* Make a nice default story.
* Make zmaps store [Items](https://github.com/drew887/Zoel/wiki/Inventory).
* Devise a good way to save room location in save files.
* Make switches that connect rooms together when pressed.

##### Notes

* I do not own openal in anyway. It is licensed under GPLv2, I have not edited it, It's just in the repo to make linking easier.
